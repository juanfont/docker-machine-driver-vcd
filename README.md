# docker-machine-driver-vcd
A VMware vCloud Director driver for Docker Machine

## Overview

This project is a little experiment to run Docker Machine on top of vCloud Director virtual machines. 

Apparently there are still use cases for this in 2021 ðŸ˜‰

## Usage

ToDo.


## Credits 
This driver is partially based on the original vmwarevcloudair (https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/drivers/vmwarevcloudair) and on https://github.com/jxoir/docker-machine-driver-vcloud-director.
