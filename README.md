# docker-machine-driver-vcd
A VMware vCloud Director driver for Docker Machine

## Overview

This project is a little experiment to run Docker Machine on top of vCloud Director virtual machines. 

Apparently there are still use cases for this in 2021 ðŸ˜‰

## Usage

ToDo.


## Credits 
This driver is based on other drivers:

- The original vmwarevcloudair https://github.com/docker/machine/tree/master/drivers/vmwarevcloudair
- This vcd driver targeting an old version of govcd https://github.com/jxoir/docker-machine-driver-vcloud-director
- The Scaleway driver, somehow https://github.com/scaleway/docker-machine-driver-scaleway
